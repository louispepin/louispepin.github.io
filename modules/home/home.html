    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>
        As I'm sure you've already guessed from the logo, my name is Louis Pepin. I'm 22 years old and I study Computer
        Engineering at Polytechnique in Montreal and I am working on this website as a side project in order to put
        some of that knowledge into practice and to learn new things. You're welcome to take a look around! <br/>

    <h3>Programming Experience</h3>
    <p>
        I worked as a full-stack developer for Benz-Info solutions in summer 2014. Other than that, most of what I know
        I've learned from school or other personal projects. These mostly include small mobiles games and various
        hackathons and programming events.<br/><br/>

        For example, in 2012, me and a team of friends made
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kD5qyUW4a7s">this little game</a>
        for the GCA (Great Canadian Appathon) competition and made it among the top 10 teams in all Canada while
        in our first year at Polytechnique.<br/><br/>

        My most well-known languages are C++, C#, Javascript, Python and Java. I learn fairly quickly and I'm
        definitely interested in trying out new things - getting some experience in lower level programming is
        something I'm especially looking forward to.

        I'm also experienced with Unix systems. I have been using Linux as my main OS at home for over 6 years, during
        many of which it was the only OS I possessed. This is the case right now (I use the IntelliJ IDEs for most of
        what I do, they're available for free on Linux and are the best I've used on any platform).
