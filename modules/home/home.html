    <h3>Welcome!</h3>
    <p>
        As I'm sure you've already guessed from the logo, my name is Louis Pepin. I'm 22 years old and I study Computer
        Engineering at Polytechnique in Montreal and I am working on this website as a side project in order to put
        some of that knowledge into practice and to learn new things. You're welcome to take a look around! <br/>

    <h3>Other things that I do</h3>
    <p>
        Even though I do like web development, it is not the only thing that I do. I'm also involved in an embedded
        systems project with PolyOrbite, a group of students who assemble to participate in the biannual
        Canadian Satellite Design Challenge. We finished
        <a href="http://polyorbite.ca/blog/2014/06/19/csdc-2012-2014-final-results/">third</a>
        last year and hope to achieve an even better result in 2016.

        <br/><br/>

        I'm also interested in mobile development. With a group of friends, we are currently working on the release of
        an android application for the websitses <a href="http://www.anilist.co">anilist.co</a> and
        <a href="http://www.anichart.net">anichart.net</a> whose creator and main developer we met
        at a convention this summer.
