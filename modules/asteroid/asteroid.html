        <h3>RULES</h3>
        <p>
            You are the commander of a spaceship lost in the asteroid belt. You must
            defend yourself and your crew against these gigantic rocks if you are to
            ever see your friends and family again. Don't let them drop your lives to
            zero!<br><br>
            <b>ADVENTURE: </b> You begin at level 1. Each level has an increasing number of asteroids
            with increasing speed. Live long enough and you just might get a bonus!<br><br>
            <b>SURVIVAL: </b> There are no levels. There is only you and a shit ton of
            sharp looking rocks. Survive as long as you can! You shall not be forgotten.<br>
