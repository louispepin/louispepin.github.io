    <h2>Problem 2: Even Fibonacci numbers</h2>

    <p class="description">
        Each new term in the Fibonacci sequence is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first 10 terms will be:
    <p>
    <p style="text-align: center">1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, ...</p>
    <p>
        By considering the terms in the Fibonacci sequence whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.
    </p>

    <pre class="box"><code class="source">
    var sum = 0;

    var prev = 1;
    var current = 1;

    while (current < 4000000) {

        if (current % 2 == 0)
            sum += current;

        var next = prev + current;
        prev = current;
        current = next;
    }
