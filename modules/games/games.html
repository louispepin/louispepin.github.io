    <h3>Games</h3>
    <p>
        A while ago, I decided to try my hand at writing simple 2D games using Javascript and an HTML5 canvas. What
        came out of it was posted here for you to play! These games are not 100% finished and will probably never be,
        it's hard just to keep track of everything I've been thinking I could add.
